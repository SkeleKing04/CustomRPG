## CONCEPT
Characters have a class and a subclasses
Classes are basic classes such as "warrior", "mage" and "archer".
Subclasses work somewhat like a "type" or "element" that are ontop of the chosen class
Characters gain a moveset based on the chosen class and subclass, this moveset is contain
### Things to do
Character Creator and Saver
- This is a character
 - '62427733113671752314302735504981443345053jeff'
 - The first two digits is the class (62)
 - the next two is the subclass (42)
 - the following digits are the abilities and their cores
 - the first two is the ability itself (77)
 - the next single digit is the number of cores in the move (3)
 - the digits following correspond to a core (31, 13, 67)
 - this repeats three more times, but with another number in-front of the move number
 - this tells whether or not the move is subclass exclusive
 - the name is at the very end
 - In short, this character uses the 62nd class and 42nd subclass. Their class based ability is the 77th ability with 3 cores, numbers 31, 13 and 67. Their first ability is subclass based and is abilitynumber 75 with 2 cores, numbers 31 and 43. Their next ability is not subclass based and is ability number 27 with 3 cores, numbers 55, 4 and 98. And their last ability is subclass based and is ability number 44 with 3 cores, numbers 34, 50 and 53. Lastly, the characters name is "jeff".
 - It looks a little confusing to us, but a computer can read this easily.
